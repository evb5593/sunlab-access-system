Project 1 - SUN Lab Access System

Name: Essam Benamar  
Email: evb5593@psu.edu  
Course: CMPSC 487W  

Notes:
- From my understanding, deleting database entries directly through Firebase 
  would cost money. To address this, I implemented a workaround: entries older than 5 years are 
  automatically deleted upon webpage load. If this system was theoretically used somewhat 
  frequently, this would function the same as deleting them through Firebase.
  
- I was uncertain about whether activating and suspending an ID was optional, so I 
  implemented it regardless.
  
- I also added the ability to sort access logs by ID, user type, retrieval date, 
  scan direction, and active/inactive status.

- Opening the project directly from the index.html will cause a CORS error
